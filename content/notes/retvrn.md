the phrase *reject modernity, embrace tradition* is simultaneously braindead and still-born. 

like many movements which exist primarily in terminally online spaces, what the greco-roman statue avatars are demanding when they call to ʀᴇᴛᴠʀɴ is that modernity's corpse be resuscitated, marionette strings be attached to its worm-eaten limbs so it can be made to dance on late night television like *jerry springer* meets *weekend at bernie's* (some historical references there for you so you know i'm serious).

modernity is dead. man killed it while god's corpse was still mostly warm. it died in the atomic fire over hiroshima.
