a delusion is a belief that does not reflect reality, held despite contrary evidence. 

broadly, there are three kinds of delusionals:

1. the grifter: aware that their professed beliefs don't reflect reality, instead expressing them instrumentally for social or financial gain
2. the crazy: genuinely believe their delusions, are incapable of responding to contrary evidence
3. the confused: aren't in contact with reality enough to know whether their beliefs are true or false

the third type are by far the most numerous, and in a sense the most tragic. in san francisco the canonical example is often the founder in their early 20's, embedded in a social circle of the same. not that there aren't exceptions. 

in san francisco you can be delusional for a long time.
