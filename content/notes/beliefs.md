some beliefs:

- technological progress is the most important and perhaps sole driver of human flourishing
  - apparent shifts in social norms, political systems, etc. are ultimately driven by technological change

- the world is undergoing enormous change, driven by demographic, technological, and socio-cultural factors
    - fundamental historical forces are driving the world toward a period of instability
      - 20th century political formulas are running on fumes, nothing has yet emerged to conclusively replace them
      - instability creates both risk and opportunity
      - some of the main players are already on the board, others are yet to appear
    - intra-elite competition sets the direction of change

- [people are mostly insane](rational)
    - people confuse fiction and reality all the time; e.g. most people's understanding of the second world war is from movies
      - by presenting historical events in the same medium as popular fiction, the events become fictionalized in people's minds
    - it's really easy to be delusional, thinking is hard
    - peopel easily delude themselves into believing they're rational

- the 'low hanging fruit' hypothesis regarding scientific progress is obviously wrong
  - in every era of scientific progress, the 'low hanging fruit' are the easy problems that are solved first
  - kuhn's model of puctuated equilibrium fits the historical facts
  - science is mainly suffering from managerialization

- more opportunity exists for more people than they are aware of
    - absent illness or obligation, many people would be much happier doing something completely different than what they're doing now
    - reasonably intelligent people can learn how most things work
    - the world is much wilder than you think

- elite is better than non-elite is really capable of understanding
  - a large fraction of elite performance is the ability to sustain obsessive focus for a very long time
  - 'everyone is winging it' is cope, but most people will never experience elite performance so don't believe it exists

- human cognition is very weak relative to the complexity of the physical world
    - mathematics is far from universal
    - we have enormous gaps in our understanding of even basic, classical physical phenomena
