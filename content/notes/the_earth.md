There are many and varied textures of the earth, the soil itself, when held or touched by the hand and the fingertips, when rubbed over the skin; it extends beyond the tacticle sensations into visual, olfactory, it digs into memory itself. Sense-memory of place can be tied to the earth. 

At the surface the earth is mostly pliant, but hard, solid formations are exposed; they integrate organically with the surrounding soil or else stand out as separate massifs, displaced in a temporally distant era as relics. They are implacable to the ages, they wait for the earth to shape itself around them once more. 

The soil in the forest and the sand of the desert speak in different ways. They carry different meanings, and around them different societies form. The earth, soil and sand inform the burial rites of their people, and in doing so their relationship with eternitity. 

The soil warms and cools with the seasons and the daytime, the changes are smooth, the earth may freeze and thaw, unevenly and in many layers, in places penetrated by water, by stone and by flora.
