I am mainly working on my startup, [Chroma](trychroma.com). Some other things I made include:

- [MathLLM](https://github.com/atroyn/math-llm), a [very simple agent](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1669111409727410176?s=20) which lets large language models ground their mathematical reasoning using a software proof assistant.
- [Bay Area Bed Frame Grants](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1577082586337226752?s=20), a grant to give people in the bay area bed frames so they don't sleep on the floor.
